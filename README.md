## Daveblog Posterous Theme

Many have asked to peek at my current Posterous theme, so here is the unadulterated truth that you are completely free to steal and resell to your heart's content.

You'll notice that many things on here are hardcoded. You'll want to replace the navigation bar links with the Posterous pages/links enumeration. The profile blurb at the bottom should use the Posterous user profile instead of my personal excerpt. Tagging, pages, and post list/show are all functional.

Please host the stylesheet on your own servers instead of linking to mine!
